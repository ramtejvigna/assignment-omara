# Database Query Fixes

## Issues Identified

Based on the error logs showing:
1. `pq: bind message supplies 1 parameters, but prepared statement "" requires 4`
2. `invalid timestamp` errors

## Root Causes and Fixes Applied

### 1. Parameter Binding Issues

**Problem**: Empty SQL queries or malformed prepared statements were being created, likely due to:
- Empty or invalid userIDs being passed to database queries
- Missing transaction handling causing statement corruption

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added input validation in all service functions to prevent empty parameters
- Improved transaction handling with proper rollback mechanisms
- Added explicit parameter validation in `getOrCreateUser()`, `GetDocuments()`, `GetDocument()`, and chat service functions

### 2. Timestamp Handling Issues

**Problem**: `COALESCE(uploaded_at, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)` was causing "invalid timestamp" errors in PostgreSQL.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Replaced `COALESCE()` with explicit `CASE WHEN` statements for better timestamp handling
- Added explicit `timestamp` column in INSERT statements for chat_history table
- Updated document creation to explicitly set `created_at` field

### 3. Transaction Management

**Problem**: Database operations were not properly using transactions, leading to inconsistent states.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added proper transaction handling in `CreateDocument()` function
- Improved error handling and rollback mechanisms
- Added better defer functions to handle panics and rollbacks

## Specific Changes Made

### handlers.go
- Added userID validation in `getOrCreateUser()`
- Improved transaction handling with proper rollback defer function
- Explicitly set `created_at` timestamp in user creation

### document.go
- Added input validation for all parameters in `CreateDocument()`, `GetDocuments()`
- Replaced `COALESCE()` with `CASE WHEN` for timestamp handling
- Added transaction management for document creation
- Improved error handling and cleanup

### chat.go
- Added input validation for `documentID`, `userID`, and `message` parameters
- Added explicit `timestamp` column in INSERT statements
- Ensured proper parameter binding for all chat history operations

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with empty parameters**: Ensure the application properly rejects empty userIDs, documentIDs, etc.
2. **Test timestamp handling**: Verify that documents and chat messages are created with proper timestamps
3. **Test transaction rollbacks**: Ensure failed operations properly roll back database changes
4. **Test concurrent access**: Verify that multiple users can access the system simultaneously without parameter binding issues

## Monitoring

The fixes include better error logging with specific error messages to help identify future issues:
- Input validation errors will show specific parameter names
- Database errors will include more context about the failing operation
- Transaction errors will be logged with proper error propagation

These changes should resolve the parameter binding and timestamp errors while making the system more robust and easier to debug.
